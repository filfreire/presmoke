# presmoke
my attempt at publishing something into ruby's "npmpackages" thingy


## How to build

```
gem build presmoke.gemspec
gem install presmoke-0.0.0.gem
```

## How to publish

```
gem push presmoke-0.0.0.gem
```

## Notes
Stuff I followed to be able to publish it:
- [Make your own gem](https://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/)
- [Publish to rubygems](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/08/26/publish-to-rubygems.html)

You can find the gem [here](https://rubygems.org/gems/presmoke)

I'm using [rvm](http://rvm.io/)
